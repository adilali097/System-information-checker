Certainly! To create a simple Termux command, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a new file named `systemInfoViewer` without any file extension:

```bash
touch systemInfoViewer
```

2. Open the file using a text editor like Nano:

```bash
nano systemInfoViewer
```


4. Save the changes and exit the text editor.

5. Make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x systemInfoViewer
```

Now, you can run your Termux command:

```bash
./systemInfoViewer
```

This script will display basic system information when executed in Termux. You can customize and extend it based on your requirements.
